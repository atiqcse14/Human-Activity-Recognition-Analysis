# Human-Activity-Recognition-Analysis

Human activity recognition process is an important topic now a days, because everything is now track-able and every person needs to track his/her activity to maintain health issues. In this research, step by step experiments are carried out. The first step of the total research is to preprocess the data. The main features were analyzed along with the activity analysis. There were some changes done like changing attribute name, balance blank values etc as the dataset is slightly imbalanced. Then the six activities were separated into two categories like static and dynamic categories and this total separation was based on ‘tBodyAccMagmean’ feature. LR (Multinomial), LSVM, and RF methods were applied to analyze the accurate value regarding this dataset. These all are the part of ML algorithms analysis.

A five-layered customized Neural Network was designed. There was one input layer, three hidden layers, and one output layer in the architecture. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used here for the reduction of variables by extracting important features. Here, the ReLU activation function was used for the input layer along with the softmax activation function for the output layer. After training the data with the customized NN, 96.47% accuracy was achieved.
